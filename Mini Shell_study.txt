Mini Shell_study

1.Shell Basics:

Shell reads user input.
Shell interprets and executes the command.
Shell displays output.

2.Basic Structure of a Shell:

Initialize a loop to continuously read user input.
Parse the input to separate the command and its arguments.
Execute the command using system calls.
Handle built-in commands (e.g., cd, exit).

3.Error Handling:
Handle errors

4.Implement Advanced Features:
Handle piping (|), redirection (>, <), etc


Topics:
-parsing, 
-argument checking, 
-execution, 
-redirection,
-piping,
-environment variables (ver melhor isto),
-built-in functions,
-signal handling.


Pseudocode:

1.Initialize the Shell:

Display a prompt.
Read user input*

2.Parse Input:

Split the input string into command and arguments.

3.Execute Command:
AINDA N PERCEI MT BEM ESTA PARTE; TA NO PROCESSO: ACEITO EXPLICACOES/SUGESTOES

4.Handle Built-in Commands:

Implement commands like cd and exit.


USER INPUT:
1. check that the input is valid and error-free
2. break down each individual tokens into an ordered list
3. check if there are any errors in the syntax
4. parse them into an execution tree
